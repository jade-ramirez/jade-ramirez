<h1>Hello I'm Jade</h1>
<p>I'm a junior at the <a href = "https://www.utah.edu/"> University of Utah </a>
majoring in Economics and minoring in computer science, math and linguistics. I am also pursuing 
a certificate in <a href = "https://linguistics.utah.edu/undergraduate/computational-linguistics-certificate/index.php">computational linguistics</a>. 
Currently I'm a financial counselor at <a href = "https://financialwellness.utah.edu/">University of Utah's Financial Wellness Center</a> but 
I plan to soon shift to a more technical role in the finance industry.

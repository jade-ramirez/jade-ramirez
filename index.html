          <h3>university of utah vita tax clinics</h3>
          <p>I was a supervisor and organizer of the tax clinics at the University of Utah. I helped train volunteers, write grants, and design the program. The program helps resident and non-resident students file their taxes. Additionally I was a TA for the class/internship for this program.

          <h3>a woman's worth: the inequities of utah's workforce</h3>
          <p>This is a forum that Women in Economics helped produce. At that time I was founder and president of women in economics and was in charge of organizing this joint initiative with the Hickely Institute of Politics. Our forum received roughly 60 attendees and was featured in local news.

          <h3>intentional spending challenge</h3>
          <p>At the Financial Wellness Center I designed and taught a course called Intentional Spending Challenge. The focus of the course was to inform students about their own spending and how to intentionally manage their spending. The course went over the psychology of spending, the history of consumerism, and current business practices that encourage spending.

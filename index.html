    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p style="padding-left: 2.5em;">Hey I'm Jade; I use she/her pronouns. I'm an aspiring statistician with a deep appreciation for math, linguistics, computer science and beyond.
      Whether I'm in a team meeting, or doing work alone I bring a mix of curiosity, creativity and 
    flexibility to the table. Outside of work you'd find me hiking, reading or trying something new.</p>

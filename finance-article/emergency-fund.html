    <h2>What is an Emergency Fund?</h2>
    <p>People save for primarily two reasons: future consumption and protection against <span class="tooltip" style="display: inline;">income or expense shocks <span class="tooltiptext">unforeseen financial shocks such as job loss, or unexpected repairs</span></span>. 
        An emergency fund would be the latter; it is savings set aside to cover unexpected expenses or financial emergencies. With emergencies the question is not <em>if</em> they will happen, but <em>when</em> they will happen. When your car inevitability breaks down 
        or you inevitability have to call out of work sick are you able to cover the expense or will you have to rely on credit cards? Currently about a third 
        of Americans do not have enough to pay an emergency 400 dollar expense. Meaning that many Americans would have to rely on credit cards or loans to cover unexpected expenses. An emergency fund is meant to protect you against unnecessary debt, and to provide peace of mind in the event of an emergency.
    </p> 
    
    <h2>How Much Should Be In My Emergency Fund?</h2>
    <p>Most financial advisors recommend saving three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Given that the average length of unemployment in the US as of this writing is around 22 weeks <a href = "https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t12.htm">[2]</a>  
    6 months seems to be a more appropriate amount to save for those in volatile job markets. However there are various factors to consider when establishing an emergency fund goal. Firstly take a look at your monthly expenses, those with 
    low expenses can get away with a smaller emergency fund but those with higher expenses automatically have higher savings goals. Secondly consider your support system, if you were to lose your job would you have family or friends to help you out? In 
    my experience as a counselor this is the reason why many college students have lower emergency funds, because worst comes to worst their parents would be willing to help them out. Thirdly consider your job security, salaried workers tend to have more stability 
    then self employed workers or those in the gig economy. If you are in a volatile job market, or have a job that is prone to layoffs then you should consider saving on the higher end of the three to six month range. Lastly consider your ability to borrow. In most of 
     these scenarios the other alternative is to borrow money. If borrowing money is significantly harder for you (i.e. no credit history, international student, etc) then consider having a larger emergency fund.    
</p>

      <h2>What Should I Do With An Emergency Fund </h2>
   <p>Emergency funds should be held primarily in cash. It is only recommended that more affluent persons invest a portion of their assets. For those cases after saving the proper amount of three to six months the rest of your emergency fund can be invested in a 
    portfolio consistent with your risk tolerance and investment goals <a href = "https://www.financialplanningassociation.org/article/all-cash-emergency-fund-strategy-appropriate-all-investors"> [1]</a>. However those  just starting out or 
    with lower income highly <span class = "tooltip">liquid assets <span class = "tooltiptext">easily accessible assets that can be quickly converted to cash</span></span> are recommended.
   </p>

    <h2>How Effective Are Emergency Funds? </h2>
    <p> As mentioned before emergencies are great ways to protect yourself against unforeseen circumstances; however, in essence an emergency fund is unproductive. It is money that sits and
        theoretically does not grow -<a href= "hysa.html">except for the small interest you may earn on it </a>-. So people tend to question the benefits of having an emergency fund over 
        investing or paying down debt. General financial advice dictates that you should prioritize building an emergency fund before investing or paying down debt, with the exception of high-interest debt and minimum monthly payments.
        The key concept is to prevent further debt, or early withdrawals from long term investments by having an emergency fund. Research has shown that households with low rates of return such as CDs and emergencies as frequent as every 4 years are the most optimal for emergency funds <a href = "https://www.afcpe.org/news-and-publications/journal-of-financial-counseling-and-planning/volume-11-2/%EF%BB%BFshould-households-establish-emergency-funds/">[3]</a>.
        Additionally, having an emergency fund is known to reduce financial stress and is the strongest predictor of financial well-being <a href = "https://corporate.vanguard.com/content/dam/corp/research/pdf/relationship_between_emergency_savings_financial_well_being_financial_stress.pdf">[4]</a>.

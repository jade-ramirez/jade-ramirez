    <h2>What is an Emergency Fund?</h2>
    <p>People save for primarily two reasons: future consumption and protection against <span class="tooltip" style="display: inline;">income or expense shocks <span class="tooltiptext">unforeseen financial shocks such as job loss, or unexpected repairs</span></span>. 
        An emergency fund would be the latter; it is savings set aside to cover unexpected expenses or financial emergencies. With emergencies the question is not <em>if</em> they will happen, but <em>when</em> they will happen. When your car inevitability breaks down 
        or you inevitability have to call out of work sick are you able to cover the expense or will you have to rely on credit cards? An emergency fund is a financial safety net that can help you avoid going into debt when the unexpected occurs. 
    </p>
    
    <h2>How Much Should Be In My Emergency Fund?</h2>
    <p>Most financial advisors recommend saving three to six months' worth of living expenses in an emergency fund. Given that the average length of unemployment in the US as of this writing is around 22 weeks <a href = "https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t12.htm">[2]</a>  
    6 months seems to be a more appropriate amount to save for those in volatile job markets. However, the amount you should save in your emergency fund depends on your individual circumstances, such as your support system and job stability. If you have a stable job and low expenses, you may be able to get by with a smaller emergency fund. 
    On the other hand, if you have a high expenses or an unstable job, you may want to save more.
    </p>

      <h2>What Should I Do With An Emergency Fund </h2>
   <p>Emergency funds should be held primarily in cash. It is only recommended that more affluent persons invest a portion of their assets. For those cases after saving the proper amount of three to six months the rest of your emergency fund can be invested in a 
    portfolio consistent with your risk tolerance and investment goals <a href = "https://www.financialplanningassociation.org/article/all-cash-emergency-fund-strategy-appropriate-all-investors"> [1]</a>. However those those just starting out or 
    with lower income highly <span class = "tooltip">liquid assets <span class = "tooltiptext">easily accessible assets that can be quickly converted to cash</span></span>.
   </p>

    <h2>How Effective Are Emergency Funds? </h2>
    <p> As mentioned before emergencies are great ways to protect yourself against unforeseen circumstances; however, in essence an emergency fund is unproductive. It is money that sits and
        theoretically does not grow -<a href= "finance-article\hysa.html">except for the small interest you may earn on it </a>-. So people tend to question the benefits of having an emergency fund over 
        investing or paying down debt. General financial advice dictates that you should prioritize building an emergency fund before investing or paying down debt, with the exception of high-interest debt and minimum monthly payments.
        The key concept is to prevent further debt, or early withdrawals from long term investments by having an emergency fund. Research has shown that households with low rates of return and emergencies as frequent as every 4 years are the most optimal for emergency funds <a href = "https://www.afcpe.org/news-and-publications/journal-of-financial-counseling-and-planning/volume-11-2/%EF%BB%BFshould-households-establish-emergency-funds/">
